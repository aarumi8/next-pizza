## Description

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This is a demo app of the full stack e-commerce store for ordering food where users can choose pizzas or products, add them to a cart, make an order and sign in to the app to see the saved orders. The app is working all you need to do is paste your .env variables to YooKassa provider(payment gateway) and Postgres DB.

Built using Next.js App Router, Zustand, Prisma, NextAuth, React Hook Form, ShadCN and TailwindCSS. The app is deployed on Vercel - https://next-pizza-theta-pied.vercel.app

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
